<h3>Avocado</h3>

      <!--------- Avocado Ingredients ---------->

<h4>Ingredients</h4>

  <ol>
      <li>12 Avocado Skins</li>
      <li>12 Avocado Pits</li>
      <li>Soda Ash (Scour)</li>
      <li>Alum / or Wheat Bran (Mordant)</li>
  </ol>

      <!--------- Avocado Materials ---------->

<h4>Materials</h4>

  <ol>
      <li>Large Cooking Pot</li>
      <li>Wooden Spoon</li>
      <li>Fabric/Yarn/Roving</li>
  </ol>


  <h4>How To</h4>

  <p>First wash the material in hot water, using a pH neutral soap or soda ash. Dry either on a line or in the dryer. If you&#39;re using the fabric right away it can remain damp. Dissolve the alum in warm water and allow the material to soak for 2 hours or more, this process helps the color stick to the fabric. The longer the better. Next clean the avocado peels and pits if you haven&#39;t already done so. Place the avocado scraps into a cooking pot and fill with water until all of the avocado is submerged. Allow the avocados to simmer for a couple hours, or until you start noticing a strong reddish pigment. Then strain the dye and remove all avocado remains.</p>

  <p>After taking the fabric out of the alum wash the fabric thoroughly either with running water or with a chalk bath. Then, place the fabric in the dye. When the fabric is damp before being placed in the dye it helps for the color to be more even. Stir the fabric occasionally, and let it sit in the dye for a couple hours while keeping the water at a simmer. When the color reaches a salmon pink then you have achieved your color.</p>

  <p>To make more of a purple color remove the salmon pink fabric, and add a very small amount of iron. I would stick to around a small pinch and allow the dye to dissolve it. Be very careful when using iron because everything you touch can effect your fabric, so be sure your hands and tools are always clean when handling the material. Test the color on small swatches until you achieve the color that you are looking for. If you want it to be lighter you can always add more water. Water acts as white and iron acts as black.</p>

<h3>Black Bean</h3>

    <!--------- Black Bean Ingredients ---------->

<h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>1-2 lbs. of non hydrated Black Beans</li>
      <li>Alum (Mordant)</li>
      <li>Soda Ash (for scouring and/or after-bath)</li>
    </ol>

    <!--------- Black Bean Materials ---------->

<h4>Materials</h4>

      <ol>
        <li>Large Cooking pot</li>
        <li>Wooden Spoon</li>
        <li>Fabric/Yarn/Roving</li>
      </ol>


<h4>How To</h4>

  <p>Place black beans in the pot and add water, be sure to fill the pot generously because the beans will absorb some of the water. Allow them to soak for 1-3 days, you will start to notice the water turning a murky brown or dark purple color. The longer they sit the stronger the color will become. Remove the beans from the pot and strain the dye to make sure that you remove all of the sediment.</p>

  <p>The material that you have chosen should be properly scoured in soda ash or dawn, then mordanted in alum. This will help for the dye to stick to the material. Once you&#39;ve completed that process add the material to the dye pot and bring the dye to a simmer. Allow the fabric to sit in the dye until you start getting the color that you would like to reach. In my testing cotton has been purple, linen has been more blue, and charmeuse was a deep blue.</p>

  <p>To create more of a bluish green color create a soda ash after-bath with a teaspoon of soda ash dissolved in hot water. When the fabric is added you will see a noticeable change right away. Soda ash will also help with the lightfastness of the material.</p>

<h3>Turmeric</h3>

        <!--------- Turmeric Ingredients ---------->

<h4>Ingredients</h4>

      <ol>
        <li>8 Tablespoons Turmeric Powder</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Table Salt</li>
        <li>Soda Ash (Scour)</li>
        <li>Alum (Mordant)</li>
      </ol>

        <!--------- Turmeric Materials ---------->

<h4>Materials</h4>

      <ol>
        <li>Large Cooking Pot</li>
        <li>Wooden Spoon</li>
        <li>Fabric/Yarn/Roving</li>
      </ol>



<h4>How To</h4>

      <p>In a large cooking pot add 16 cups of water and 8 tablespoons of turmeric powder, and 2 tablespoons of table salt. Allow the water to come to a simmer for up to half an hour. Do not allow the water to get too hot or else the turmeric may become too hot and burn the side of your pot, this can create dark spots on your fabric.</p>

      <p>Scour your fabric in soda ash or with a pH neutral soap. Do this by adding soda ash to a pot then bringing the water to a simmer for an hour. Then mordant your fabric in alum, and repeat the same process as scouring. Rinse the mordant off then place the damp material in the turmeric. Let the material rest in the dye until you achieve the color that you want.</p>

      <p>To achieve different colors put the material in for a short period of time to to get a light yellow, or put the material in longer to get a mustard color. Different kinds of fabrics can also give you different shades of yellow. </p>
